YX : SCSS : NO-JS KEN BURNS
===========================

> A simple slideshow with a Ken Burns touch, based on a pen by "[Nicola Pressi][pen]".

I really loved how Nicola did this slider using only CSS animations, and wanted to make it easy for me to build similar sliders for me and for other projects too, so I cooked these mixins to help me do that! :wink:
